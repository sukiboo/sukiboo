### Hey there, I'm Anton 🐣

I'm an ML researcher with a PhD in mathematics and a drive for exploring interdisciplinary applications of AI.\
Check out ✨[my website](https://www.dereventsov.com/)✨ for more information on my professional background!

Things I'm doing outside of work:
- 👾 experimenting with generative AI and LLMs
- 🎭 establishing applications of ML in behavioral science
- 🐍 optimizing mundane everyday tasks with the power of Python
- 📚 writing and organizing code for my [research publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RHigEzkAAAAJ)
- 💻 relentlessly trying to get better at [programming](https://leetcode.com/sukiboo/)

I'm open to collaboration and have lots of potential project ideas in various topics of ML.\
Get in touch if you're interested in some jolly cooperation!
